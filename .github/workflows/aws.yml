# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "main" branch.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps: a
#
# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
#    Replace the value of the `ECR_REPOSITORY` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.
#    Replace the value of the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.
#
# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service..
#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_SERVICE` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_CLUSTER` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster..
#
# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` environment variable in the workflow below with the path to the JSON file.
#    Replace the value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable in the workflow below with the name of the container
#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
#
# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials. .

#Step 1: Checking Out Your Code
#--------------------------------
#- Uses 'actions/checkout' to fetch code from your GitHub repository.
#- Provides the runner (virtual machine) with access to the source code.
#- Required for performing tasks like testing, building, and deploying.
#
#Step 2: Running Tests
#----------------------
#- Command: `go test ./...`
#- Executes tests written for your application in the Go language.
#- Validates application functionality before proceeding to deployment.
#- Stops the workflow if a test fails (to avoid deploying broken code).
#
#Step 3: Configuring AWS Credentials
#------------------------------------
#- Action: `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`
#- Purpose: Logs into AWS using credentials stored as GitHub secrets.
#  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS user access key.
#  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS user secret access key.
#  - `aws-region`: The AWS region, e.g., `us-east-1`.
#- Ensures the workflow can securely interact with AWS services like ECR and ECS.
#
#Step 4: Logging Into Amazon ECR
#--------------------------------
#- Action: `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login`
#- Authenticates the workflow with Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
#- Allows pushing Docker images to ECR for storage and later deployment.
#
#Step 5: Building, Tagging, and Pushing Docker Images
#-----------------------------------------------------
#- Actions:
#  - `docker build` creates the Docker image with application code and dependencies.
#  - `docker tag` assigns a unique identifier (e.g., commit hash) to the image.
#  - `docker push` uploads the image to Amazon ECR.
#- Purpose:
#  - Package your application into a lightweight, portable container.
#  - Upload it to ECR for deployment in Amazon ECS.
#
#Step 6: Filling In the Updated Docker Image in the ECS Task Definition
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#- Action: `aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition`
#- Updates the ECS Task Definition with the latest Docker image pushed to ECR.
#- Ensures that the container definition uses the new image version during deployment.
#
#Step 7: Deploying the Updated Task Definition to Amazon ECS
#------------------------------------------------------------
#- Action: `aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition`
#- Applies the updated Task Definition to the specified ECS Service in a Cluster.
#- ECS Service: A long-running instance of your application (e.g., backend API).
#- ECS Cluster: A group of computing resources (EC2 instances or Fargate) that host containers.
#- Process waits until ECS ensures the service is stable before marking deployment as complete.
